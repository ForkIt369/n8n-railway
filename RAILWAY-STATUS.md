# ðŸš‚ Railway n8n Deployment Status

## Current Status: âœ… Deployed (Without Persistent Storage)

### What's Working
- âœ… Docker image built successfully
- âœ… Service deployed to Railway
- âœ… All 18 environment variables configured
- âœ… Domain generated: `brovagents-production.up.railway.app`
- âœ… Port 5678 configured

### Pending Configuration
Add these domain variables in Railway Dashboard â†’ Variables:
```
WEBHOOK_URL=https://brovagents-production.up.railway.app
N8N_HOST=brovagents-production.up.railway.app
N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL=https://brovagents-production.up.railway.app
PORT=5678
```

### Known Issue: No Persistent Storage
Railway Volumes section not appearing despite Hobby plan ($5/month).

**Workaround Options:**
1. Run without persistence (workflows lost on redeploy)
2. Export/import workflows manually
3. Use external PostgreSQL database
4. Contact Railway support about missing Volumes

### Access Your n8n
After adding domain variables and redeploy completes (~2-3 minutes):
- URL: https://brovagents-production.up.railway.app
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `n8n-railway-2025`

```

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Check deployment logs
railway logs

# Force redeploy
railway up

# Open Railway dashboard
railway open
```

### Next Steps
1. Add the domain variables above
2. Wait for auto-redeploy
3. Test access at https://brovagents-production.up.railway.app
4. Export workflows from local n8n (http://localhost:5678)
5. Import to Railway n8n

### Local n8n Still Running
Your local n8n is still accessible at http://localhost:5678
Use this to create and test workflows before deploying to production.
